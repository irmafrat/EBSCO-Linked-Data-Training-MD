# EBSCO Linked Data Training
Reusable training modules to promote linked data and BIBFRAME adoption among libraries worldwide.

The content of these training modules was originally developed for the workshop "Empowering Global Leaders: A Linked Data Training Program for Library Innovation," held May 10-12, 2023.

## Content
These [training modules](https://github.com/timathom/EBSCO-Linked-Data-Training/tree/main/content/dita) have been developed using the Learning and Training Specialization of the [Darwin Information Typing Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture) (DITA). As an XML format, DITA lends itself to reuse, translation, and reformatting. DITA projects can be transformed into other formats using the [DITA Open Toolkit](https://www.dita-ot.org/), an open-source publishing engine for DITA documentation, or edited using a platform like the [oXygen XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/25.1/ug-editor/topics/eppo-first-dita-topic.html).

The [Fluenta DITA Translation Manager](https://maxprograms.com/products/fluenta.html) was used to convert the modules into an [XLIFF file](https://github.com/timathom/EBSCO-Linked-Data-Training/blob/main/content/xliff/ebsco_training_es.ditamap.xlf), as an example for possible translation workflows (in this case into Spanish). The [Swordfish Translation Editor](https://maxprograms.com/products/swordfish.html) can also be used to translate DITA projects directly.

The content is also available here as [Markdown](https://github.com/timathom/EBSCO-Linked-Data-Training/blob/main/content/markdown/index.md) and could be transformed into other formats as needed.
