# RDF

![Illustration of an RDF triple showing a subject labeled book1, a predicate labeled title, and an object labeled Cien años de soledad. Beneath each part of the triple is a corresponding data value: an example URI for the subject resource, the Dublin Core Terms URI for title, and the literal string value Cien años de soledad.](../../submaps/../img/rdf/rdf1.svg "RDF Triple")

## Summary

-   The Resource Description Framework \(RDF\) is a simple model whose basic structure is a three-part **statement**, or **triple**.

-   It consists of a relation between **subject** and **object**, defined by a **predicate.**

-   A **resource** is anything that we want to say something about.


-   To make statements about resources, we need to **identify** them.


-   Resources are identified by Uniform Resource Identifiers \(URIs\).
