# RDF

-   In an RDF graph, each **node** \(subject or object\) is a resource that we can say things about.

-   The **edges** in the graph are also resources, but we can't really say things about them in practice.


**Note:**

Work is currently underway to update the RDF specifications from version 1.1 to [1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-concepts/). The new versions will include support for what is known as **RDF-Star**, which will define a model and syntax for making statements about an entire triple rather than only a subject.
