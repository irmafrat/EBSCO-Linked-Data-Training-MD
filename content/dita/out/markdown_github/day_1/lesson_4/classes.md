# Classes

-   According to W3C standards:

    > A class is defined as a group of individuals that \[. . .\] share certain properties. For example, Deborah and Frank are members of the class Person. Classes can be organized in hierarchies of specialization. \([W3C](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/OWL-Overview-es.html#s3.1)\)

-   Names of classes are typically written with an uppercase letter.
