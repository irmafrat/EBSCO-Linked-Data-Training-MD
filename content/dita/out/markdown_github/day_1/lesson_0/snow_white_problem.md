# ChatGPT: Limits and Possibilities

**Note:**

For this topic, the instructor should have access to the ChatGPT user interface and be ready to demonstrate the [Issue](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/blog/chatgpts-snow-white-problem-the-danger-of-common-knowledge) described in the blog post by Oxford Semantic Technologies.

As of June 5, 2023, the issue is still present in GPT-3.5. In response to the prompt "Which was the first feature-length animated film?" the model provides the following answer:

> The first feature-length animated film is "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," released in 1937. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions and was based on the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm. "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was a groundbreaking achievement in animation, as it was the first full-length cel-animated feature film and the first animated film produced in color. It was a commercial and critical success and paved the way for the development of the animated film industry.

However, GPT-4.0 provides a much more nuanced response:

> The first feature-length animated film is generally recognized as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" by Walt Disney, which was released in 1937.

> However, it's worth noting that there were some earlier attempts at creating feature-length animated films. The first one to be created was "El Apóstol" \(The Apostle\), an Argentine film by Quirino Cristiani released in 1917. Unfortunately, no copies of this film exist today because it was destroyed in a fire. Another feature-length animated film by Cristiani, "Sin dejar rastros" \(Without a Trace\), was released in 1918 but has also been lost. As a result, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" is the earliest feature-length animated film that can still be viewed today.

## Summary

-   ChatGPT is a large-scale reflection of "common knowledge."
-   It is not necessarily tethered to reality and lacks a stable reference to verified and curated knowledge.
-   Knowledge graphs can complement large language models and be used to "fact check" them.
