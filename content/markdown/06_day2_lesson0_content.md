# Review of Day 1

-   In groups, discuss the content from yesterday's session.

-   What did you learn? What would you like to learn more about?

-   Do you have any questions you would like to clarify, or any observations?

-   Assign a notetaker to report back to the group.


-   In the same group, use your sketch pad to draw a network diagram of the BIBFRAME representation of the book we worked with yesterday in the card-sorting activity \(*Cien años de soledad*\).
