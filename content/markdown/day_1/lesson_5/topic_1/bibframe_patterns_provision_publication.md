![Network diagram showing an example BIBFRAME model for a Provision Activity (subclass Publication). The diagram shows a place relation to a URI representing Italy, as well as three BFLC extension properties for the simple string values extracted from the MARC source data.](../../../submaps/../img/bibframe_etc/bf_provision.svg "BIBFRAME Patterns: Provision (Publication)")

## Summary

-   BIBFRAME 2.0 defines a pattern for grouping information about the provision of a resource, such as the publication of an Instance.
-   This pattern allows data to be both recorded as both linked data \(notice the URI for Italy\) and string literals.
-   Terms from the [Library of Congress Extension Vocabulary for BIBFRAME](https://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bflc.html) \(BFLC\) are used to record "simple" place, agent, and date values.
