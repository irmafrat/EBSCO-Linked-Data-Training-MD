# Cataloging with BIBFRAME

-   First, let's review the [BIBFRAME model](https://id.loc.gov/ontologies/bibframe.html).

-   Try to match your categories against the terms in BIBFRAME

-   Now, let's use the hosted version of the Library of Congress [Marva Editor](https://bibframe.org/marva/editor/) to gain some hands-on experience with BIBFRAME.

-   Choose one of the PDF files with scanned images of a book to catalog:

    -   *Reading with Clarice Lispector*
    -   *The Versatility of Bamboo*
-   Work in groups. Half the group should work on the **Instance** description and half on the **Work** description.

-   If time allows, switch roles after finishing.
