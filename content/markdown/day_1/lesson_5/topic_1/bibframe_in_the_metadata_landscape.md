# BIBFRAME in the Metadata Landscape

![Network diagram showing the relationship between BIBFRAME and other metadata standards. The diagram depicts a graph that starts with a square node labeled BIBFRAME on the left, with edges depicting relationships to OWL, RDA, MARC 21, RDF, AACR2, and IFLA LRM. The relationships are as follows: BIBFRAME uses RDF, uses in part OWL, codifies RDA, replaces and translates MARC 21, and is inspired by IFLA LRM. Other nodes also have relationships: OWL formalizes RDF; RDA uses in part RDF, replaces AACR2, and implements IFLA LRM.](../../../submaps/../img/bibframe_etc/bf_landscape.svg "BIBFRAME Landscape")
