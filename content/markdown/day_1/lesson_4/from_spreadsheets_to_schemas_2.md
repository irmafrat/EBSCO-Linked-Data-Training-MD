# From Spreadsheets to Schemas

![Excel spreadsheet showing a list of twenty fictional workshop participants (data was generated by ChatGPT 4.0). The spreadsheet has five columns: ID, Name, User, Inst, and Loc. It is annotated with three call-out boxes at the top, with arrows pointing to different parts of the spreadsheet. The first call-out points to the spreadsheet as a whole and asks the following questions: What's the context for this spreadsheet? Is it related to a system? The second call-out points to the Inst column and asks the following questions: Institution? What is the relationship between Person and Institution? Finally, the third call-out points to the Loc column and asks the following questions: Does Loc mean Location? Is it the location of the Institution or the Person?](../../submaps/../img/ontology/participants.svg "From Spreadsheets to Triples")

## Summary

-   Let's return to our spreadsheet data.
-   Here is [an example](../../resources/data/spreadsheet_schema.ttl) of a simple ontology expressed using RDFS.
-   It provides a semantic schema for the spreadsheet.
-   It clearly identifies the entities and relationships in the data.
-   It incorporates concepts from other linked data vocabularies, such as Friend of a Friend \(FOAF\) and Schema.org.
