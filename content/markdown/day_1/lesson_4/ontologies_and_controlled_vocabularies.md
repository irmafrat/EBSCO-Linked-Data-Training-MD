# Ontologies and Controlled Vocabularies

-   An ontology allows us to define a data model the reflects reality in all its complexity.


-   For its part, a controlled vocabulary has a simpler intent.

-   It defines a list of concepts that can have hierarchical relationships, but that do not reflect a view of the world in an explicit way.

-   However, controlled vocabularies can also be created using linked data standards.

-   The [Simple Knowledge Organization System](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-skos-reference-20090818/) \(SKOS\) was created to design thesauri and controlled vocabularies in RDF.
