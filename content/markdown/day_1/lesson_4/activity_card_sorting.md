# Activity: Card Sorting

1.  Let's use the competency questions from the previous lesson as a terminology source for beginning to specify terms in our ontology.

2.  Open the PDF documents under "Card-Sorting Activity."

3.  Start with the first file \("Bibliographic Record Unlabeled"\).

4.  You will see a series of numbered cards with information extracted from a MARC 21 Bibliographic record for the novel *Cien a√±os de soledad*.

5.  The cards are in the order they appear in the record. When a card has decimal numbers, it means that the data elements come from the same field.

6.  Using the numbers, group the cards into categories.

7.  Try to identify the types of entities that are represented.

8.  Once you identify a group, give it a name and write down the criteria used for creating it.

9.  For example, "New York" is a type of Place \(or City, or Populated Place, which are specific kinds of Place\).
