# The Data Deluge

![Derivative image based on an illustration from the video What is Linked Data, by Manu Sporny. The top of the image is labeled Data. The texture of the figures in the image is meant to look like modeling clay. There are four boxes, one in each corner, and they are slightly cropped on the outer edge. The first box, on the top left, is labeled Excel and shows an abstract representation of a spreadsheet. Moving clockwise, the upper right box shows a human head surrounded by abstract letters and lines. The bottom right box contains shapes (circle and rectangle), lines and letters. The bottom left box contains an abstract design of what looks like a wound-up cord, with letters and lines. In the middle are squiggles and an arrow-like shape.](../../submaps/../img/introduction/data_formats.png "Data Formats")

**Note:**

This image and four subsequent ones were derived from screen captures of the video [*What Is Linked Data?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x_xzT5eF5Q), by Manu Sporny. Sporny's 12-minute video provides a simple introduction to the linked data concept and rationale, as it was articulated in 2012. The images include here were generated using an implementation of the Stable Diffusion image generation model.

The intent behind transforming the images was to invite reflection on how generative AI has shifted the discussion about structured data on the web and introduced new questions and possibilities.

## Summary

-   When working with data, we need to understand, describe, and process a variety of file formats and types of content.
-   The question we're faced with is, how do we keep up?
-   Are machine learning models trained on larger and larger datasets the solution?
