## Summary

-   Although it contains structured information, a printed catalog card needs to be digitized before it can be transformed into data.
-   Once it has been digitized, it can be processed by a computer.
-   As information professionals, we create **metadata** to organize content of all kinds, whether print or digital.
-   Our job as information professionals is to make sense of data, to create and structure **knowledge** from raw data.
