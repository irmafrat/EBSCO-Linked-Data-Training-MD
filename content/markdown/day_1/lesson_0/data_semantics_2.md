# Data Semantics

-   Traditionally, the rationale for Linked Open Data has been explained by talking about a web of interlinked HTML documents.

-   A plain link tells us that two documents are related, but it doesn't say how.

-   The relation is on the document level, not between the actual entities described in those documents.

-   Without being able to determine the meaning of a link, a machine's ability to process it is limited.
