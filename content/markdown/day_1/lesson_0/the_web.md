# The Web

![Derivative image based on an illustration from the video What is Linked Data, by Manu Sporny. The top of the image is labeled The Web. The texture of the figures in the image is meant to look like modeling clay. There are two pages, each half cropped on the outer edge, with abstract figures and dashes, meant to look like web pages. From the left-hand page, an arrow with the label Link extends to the right-hand page. From the right-hand page, an arrow with the label link points to a window-like figure on the left-hand page. There is a ball-like shape in the middle of the image at the bottom.](../../submaps/../img/introduction/the_web.png "The Web of Documents")
