# Machine Understanding

![Derivative image based on an illustration from the video What is Linked Data, by Manu Sporny. The texture of the figures in the image is meant to look like modeling clay. On the left, there is a representation of a simple graph diagram with a circular node in the middle that has a half-smiling cartoon face. From the center node, three edges extend on the right, with three circular nodes labeled (moving clockwise from the top), now, bithday (sic), and mood? Another edge extends on the left off the page. Below the diagram, there is a smiling white creature that may resemble a mouse. In the middle, at the bottom, is a small, animal-like, bluish cartoon figure with its arms raise and an empty speech bubble. On the right of the image, a large cartoon-like robot with a blank expression (large round eyes and a small dot for a mouth) has a speech bubble that says, Birthday?](../../submaps/../img/introduction/machine_understanding.png "Machine Understanding")
