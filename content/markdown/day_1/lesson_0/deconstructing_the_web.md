# Deconstructing the Web

![Derivative image based on an illustration from the video What is Linked Data, by Manu Sporny. The texture of the figures in the image is meant to look like modeling clay. On the left, there is a representation of a web page that is cropped on the outer edge, with abstract figures and dashes, and the word Link in a rectangle in the lower right of the page. There is a chunk that has been torn out of the middle right edge of the page. At the bottom of the image, in the middle, are three round shapes that may represent debris from the missing chunk. On the right, cropped off, two abstract human figures are visible standing under the arm and claw of an excavator construction vehicle.](../../submaps/../img/introduction/deconstructing_the_web.png "Deconstructing the Web")
