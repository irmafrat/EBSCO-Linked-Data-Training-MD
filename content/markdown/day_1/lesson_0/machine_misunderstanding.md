# Machine \(Mis\)understanding

![Derivative image based on an illustration from the video What is Linked Data, by Manu Sporny. The texture of the figures in the image is meant to look like modeling clay. On the left, there is a representation of a web page that is half cropped on the outer edge, with abstract figures and dashes, and the word Link in a circle in the lower right of the page. In the middle of the image, at the bottom, there is a small, abstract, cartoon-like figure gesturing toward the page. On the right of the image, a large cartoon-like robot is scratching its head, with a speech bubble that says, WHUT?](../../submaps/../img/introduction/say_whut.png "Machine (Mis)understanding")
