# Ontology Design

-   For example, in an ontology about food and wine, we could ask competency questions like these:

    -   Which wine characteristics should I consider when choosing a wine?

    -   Is Bordeaux a red or white wine?

    -   Does Cabernet Sauvignon go well with seafood?

    -   What is the best choice of wine for grilled meat?

    -   Which characteristics of a wine affect its appropriateness for a dish?

    -   Does a bouquet or body of a specific wine change with vintage year?

    -   What were good vintages for Napa Zinfandel? \([Ontology 101](https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf)\)
