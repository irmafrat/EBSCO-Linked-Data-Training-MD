# Ontology Design

-   One of the first steps toward creating an ontology in to develop a set of **competency questions**.

-   These are questions that serve to define the scope of an ontology and test its usefulness later on.

-   Based on these questions, we can begin to construct a data model, defining classes, properties, and individuals.
