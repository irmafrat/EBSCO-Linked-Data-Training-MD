# What Is an Ontology?

-   In computer science, an ontology is defined as:

    > *A formal definition of types, properties, and relationships between entities that actually or fundamentally exist within a particular domain of discourse.*\([Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontolog%C3%ADa_(inform%C3%A1tica))\)

-   An ontology is a **model of reality** expressed as a formal specification of **classes**, **properties**, and **individuals**.
-   An ontology is a **semantic schema** that documents the meaning of our data.
