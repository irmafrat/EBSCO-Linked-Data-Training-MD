# From Spreadsheets to Schemas

![Excel spreadsheet showing a list of twenty fictional workshop participants (data was generated by ChatGPT 4.0). The spreadsheet has five columns: ID, Name, User, Inst, and Loc. It is annotated with three call-out boxes at the top, with arrows pointing to different parts of the spreadsheet. The first call-out points to the spreadsheet as a whole and asks the following questions: What's the context for this spreadsheet? Is it related to a system? The second call-out points to the Inst column and asks the following questions: Institution? What is the relationship between Person and Institution? Finally, the third call-out points to the Loc column and asks the following questions: Does Loc mean Location? Is it the location of the Institution or the Person?](../../submaps/../img/ontology/participants.svg "From Spreadsheets to Triples")

## Summary

-   Tabular data, such as what we find in spreadsheets, is not self-documenting.
-   We can guess about the meaning of columns and fields, but without a **semantic** schema, we can't be sure that our interpretation is correct.
