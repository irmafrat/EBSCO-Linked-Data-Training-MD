# RDF Is a \(Knowledge\) Graph

![A more complex illustration showing small network graph of give connected nodes. All nodes are circles with the same pastel-orange color. The edges are orange-colored arrows. On the left, there are two nodes, labeled book1 and book2. In the middle are three nodes that are the object of triples for which book1 and book2 are the subjects. Book1 has two edges, labeled language and creator. The language edge points to a node labeled lang1, which has an edge pointing to the literal value Español. The creator edge points to a node labeled person1, which, in turn, has an edge labeled first-name pointing to the value Gabriel and an edge labeled family-name pointing to the value García Márquez. Person1 also has an edge, labeled language, point to the node labeled lang1. Finally, book2 has two edges, creator and subject. The creator edge points to person1 and the subject edge points to another node, which is labeled concept1.](../../submaps/../img/rdf/rdf3.svg "RDF Triples as a Knowledge Graph")

## Summary

When we connect enough statements about enough resources, we form a **knowledge graph**.
