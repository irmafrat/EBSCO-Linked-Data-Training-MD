# RDF Is a Graph

![Illustration of an RDF triple in a node-edge-node network diagram. Nodes are circles with the same pastel-orange color. The edge is an orange-colored arrows. The subject node on the left and is labeled book1; the edge arrow pointing from the subject node to a corrsponding object node is labeled creator in the center of the line. On the right, the object node is labeled person1. Beneath each part of the graph is a corresponding URI. The subject and object URIs are arbitrary example URIs, and the predicate URI is the Dublin Core Terms URI for creator.](../../submaps/../img/rdf/rdf2.svg "RDF Triples as a Graph")

## Summary

-   The object of a statement can be a **literal** value or another resource.

-   When we make statements that connect resources, we form a graph.
