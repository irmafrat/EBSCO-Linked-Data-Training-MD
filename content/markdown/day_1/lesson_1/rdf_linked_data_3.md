# RDF/Linked Data

-   What kind of entity is identified by [https://dle.rae.es/dato](https://dle.rae.es/dato)?

-   What are its attributes?

-   Is it related to other entities?


**Note:**

Challenge participants to think about the *type* of entity represented by this URI \(a dictionary entry\). Its attributes might include things like *definition*, *etymology*, and *grammatical gender*. Its relationships to other entities might include things like:

-   A *part of* relation to the dictionary as a whole
-   Or a single dictionary entry might consist of multiple *definitions*
-   Each definition might be related to a specific domain \(e.g., computer science\)
-   An entry might also include multiple *phrases* or *expressions* is which a term is frequently used \(e.g., *base de datos*\).
