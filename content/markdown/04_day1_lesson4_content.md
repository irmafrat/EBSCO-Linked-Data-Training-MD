# RDF Schema

-   RDF includes a schema extension focused on laying the foundation for ontology development and semantic data modeling, [RDF Schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf12-schema/) \(RDFS\)

-   It defines modeling concepts such as:

    -   **Class** \(and subclass\)

    -   **Literal**
    -   **Property** \(and subproperty\)

    -   **Domain**

    -   **Range**


# Overview of RDF Schema

![Network diagram showing the main classes and properties defined in the RDF Schema vocabulary.](../../submaps/../img/ontology/rdfs_diagram.svg "RDF Schema")


## Summary

-   With RDFS, we can begin to define hierarchies of classes and properties.
-   The Web Ontology Language \(OWL\) builds on these basic features and adds much more advanced functionality.


# Classes

-   According to W3C standards:

    > A class is defined as a group of individuals that \[. . .\] share certain properties. For example, Deborah and Frank are members of the class Person. Classes can be organized in hierarchies of specialization. \([W3C](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/OWL-Overview-es.html#s3.1)\)

-   Names of classes are typically written with an uppercase letter.


# Classes: Examples

|Class|
|-----|
|**Contribution**|
|**Item**|
|**Organization**|
|**Role**|
|**Stamp**|


# Properties

-   According to the W3C:

    > Properties can be used to establish relationships between individuals or individuals and literal data values. \([W3C](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/OWL-Overview-es.html#s3.1)\)

-   Properties are usually written with a lowercase letter, or using "Camel Case" \(e.g., **accountName**\).


# Properties: Examples

|Property|
|--------|
|**agent**|
|**contribution**|
|**date**|
|**marked by \(markedBy\)**|
|**role**|


# Individuals

Individuals are instances or members of a class.

> For example, an individual named Deborah can be described as a member of the class Person, and the property hasEmployer can be used to relate her to the individual StanfordUniversity. \([W3C](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/OWL-Overview-es.html#s3.1)\)


# Individuals: Example

![Network diagram showing an example BIBFRAME model for contributors to an inscription. The Inscription class comes from the ARM ontology. One contribution is defined with role giver and agent Zora Neale Hurston (Person), and another is defined with role receiver and agent Carl Van Vechten (Person).](../../submaps/../img/bibframe_etc/arm_inscription_bf_contributions.svg "Describing Individuals")


# Domain and Range

![Simple network diagram showing two nodes (Domain on the left and Range on the right) linked by an edge labeled Property.](../../submaps/../img/ontology/domain_range.svg "Domain and Range")


## Summary

The **domain** and **range** of a property can also be defined.

> A property domain limits the individuals that property can apply to.

> The range of a property limits the individuals it can take as its object. \([W3C](https://www.w3.org/2007/09/OWL-Overview-es.html#s3.1)\)


# Domain and Range: Examples

|**Domain**|**Property**|**Range**|
|----------|------------|---------|
|Contribution|role|Agent <br> -   Meeting <br> -   Family <br> -   Jurisdiction <br> -   Organization <br> -   Person|
|\[None\]|date|Literal|


# Ontologies and Controlled Vocabularies

-   An ontology allows us to define a data model that reflects reality in all its complexity.


-   For its part, a controlled vocabulary has a simpler intent.

-   It defines a list of concepts that can have hierarchical relationships, but that do not reflect a view of the world in an explicit way.

-   However, controlled vocabularies can also be created using linked data standards.

-   The [Simple Knowledge Organization System](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-skos-reference-20090818/) \(SKOS\) was created to design thesauri and controlled vocabularies in RDF.


# From Spreadsheets to Schemas

![Excel spreadsheet showing a list of twenty fictional workshop participants (data was generated by ChatGPT 4.0). The spreadsheet has five columns: ID, Name, User, Inst, and Loc. It is annotated with three call-out boxes at the top, with arrows pointing to different parts of the spreadsheet. The first call-out points to the spreadsheet as a whole and asks the following questions: What's the context for this spreadsheet? Is it related to a system? The second call-out points to the Inst column and asks the following questions: Institution? What is the relationship between Person and Institution? Finally, the third call-out points to the Loc column and asks the following questions: Does Loc mean Location? Is it the location of the Institution or the Person?](../../submaps/../img/ontology/participants.svg "From Spreadsheets to Triples")


## Summary

-   Let's return to our spreadsheet data.
-   Here is [an example](../../resources/data/spreadsheet_schema.ttl) of a simple ontology expressed using RDFS. Example inspired by the book [*Linked Data: Structured Data on the Web \(Wood et al., 2013\)*](https://www.manning.com/books/linked-data).
-   It provides a semantic schema for the spreadsheet.
-   It clearly identifies the entities and relationships in the data.
-   It incorporates concepts from other linked data vocabularies, such as Friend of a Friend \(FOAF\) and Schema.org.


# Activity: Card Sorting

1.  Let's use the competency questions from the previous lesson as a terminology source for beginning to specify terms in our ontology.

2.  Open the PDF documents under "Card-Sorting Activity."

3.  Start with the first file \("Bibliographic Record Unlabeled"\).

4.  You will see a series of numbered cards with information extracted from a MARC 21 Bibliographic record for the novel *Cien años de soledad*.

5.  The cards are in the order they appear in the record. When a card has decimal numbers, it means that the data elements come from the same field.

6.  Using the numbers, group the cards into categories.

7.  Try to identify the types of entities that are represented.

8.  Once you identify a group, give it a name and write down the criteria used for creating it.

9.  For example, "New York" is a type of Place \(or City, or Populated Place, which are specific kinds of Place\).

# Activity: Card Sorting, Part 2

1.  Now look through the labeled version \("Bibliographic Record Labeled"\) of the same cards.

2.  Does anything else stand out to you?

**Related information**

# Activity: Card Sorting, Part 3

1.  Look through the third document, with labeled cards representing the Library of Congress Name Authority record for Gabriel García Márquez \("Authority Record Labeled"\).

2.  Write down additional categories.


**Related information**

# Activity: Card Sorting, Part 4

1.  Try to check your competency questions against the categories you have identified.

2.  Is anything missing?

3.  Now, use your sketch pad to create some graph diagrams showing the graph of properties and relationships among the entity types you have identified.
